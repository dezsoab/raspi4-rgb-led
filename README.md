# raspi4-rgb-led
A nice little app for a common cathode RGB LED with controllable RPI Pins - written in Java

You can find a `video` about the running application here:

Since this is a common cathode LED, the longest part on the LED is going to be your `GROUND`, whereas the other 3 legs are your inputs for the individual colors. Make sure to use the appropriate resistor for your LED. (Here I am using 3x 330 Ohm resistors)
